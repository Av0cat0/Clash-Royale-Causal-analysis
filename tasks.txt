## DATELINE: 21/02 15:00
### SALEH:
- 2.1 Data Acquisition and 2.1.1 Data Structure in the article, add a graph for 2.1.1
- 2.4.2 Deck Similarity - t-SNE and MDS
-- create another graph for scaled appearances, find densed areas in both graphs, and do the same for t-sne
- 2.4.3 Causal Model

### YAGEL:
- 2.2 Exploratory Data Analysis in the article (DAG + small subsection)
- fix correlation thresholds consistency, there are 3 thresholds: 0.3,0.55,0.7, we need at most 2 so we need to discuss that
- 2.4.3 Causal Model



## DATELINE: 24/02 15:00
### SALEH:
- Finish MDS and t-SNE comprasion + add to article
- Check how to insert MVD usage in code/article
### YAGEL:
- continue with DAG aftermeth
- FP-growth algorithm
- check the following path: handle_behavior - less outliers, more of target behavior,
     yagel's idea of avg elixer<2 or >6, validate win_rate for those decks
### RONI:
- PCA: check the average data of the outliered subgraph and other subgraphs
- Graph repressentation
- DeepWalk
- change pictures to their new picture in the article
