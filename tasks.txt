## DATELINE: 25/02 15:00
### SALEH:
- 2.1 Data Acquisition and 2.1.1 Data Structure in the article, add a graph for 2.1.1
- 2.4.2 Deck Similarity - MDS
- instead of appearances, check other features and create a subset of features to analyse with MDS, such that will help us conclude conclusions about the high win-rate clusters.
- Find a way to create boundaries for decks with high win-rate, so the sub data within the boundaries will show the highest win rates (3 boundaries are good)
- delete clash royale dataset and use only the id-name dataset (we don't have time to implements its usage)


### YAGEL:
- 2.2 Exploratory Data Analysis in the article (DAG + small subsection)
- investigate DAG aftermeth
- fix correlation thresholds consistency, there are 3 thresholds: 0.3,0.55,0.7, we need at most 2 so we need to discuss that
-- YOUR GOAL IS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF THRESHOLDS FROM 3 TO 2, WITHIN THE MAIN NOTEBOOK WITH AS LOW AS POSSIBLE MODIFICATIONS
- 2.4.3 Causal Model
- tasks 8 and 9 in data file

### RONI:
- write a paragraph about why we use hamming and not cosine and jaccord, think computanally and case-wised
- add an explaination of the sampling formula
- why MDS and not t-sne 
- check saleh paragraph



## DATELINE: 27/02 15:00
### SALEH:

### YAGEL:
- Implement DAG aftermeth 
- FP-growth algorithm
- check the following path: handle_behavior - less outliers, more of target behavior,
     yagel's idea of avg elixer<2 or >6, validate win_rate for those decks
- update new pictures in the article after the LAST touch
### RONI:
- Graph repressentation
- DeepWalk
- change pictures to their new picture in the article
