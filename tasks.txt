## Main
### SALEH:
- 2.4.2 Deck Similarity - MDS
- instead of appearances, check other features and create a subset of features to analyse with MDS, such that will help us conclude conclusions about the high win-rate clusters.
- Find a way to create boundaries for decks with high win-rate, so the sub data within the boundaries will show the highest win rates (3 boundaries are good)
- modify with Roni the paragraph for paper
- combine with Roni the code from project-saleh to visualizations


### YAGEL:
- investigate DAG aftermeth
- fix correlation thresholds consistency, there are 3 thresholds: 0.3,0.55,0.7, we need at most 2 so we need to discuss that YOUR GOAL IS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF THRESHOLDS FROM 3 TO 2, WITHIN THE MAIN NOTEBOOK WITH AS LOW AS POSSIBLE MODIFICATIONS
- 2.4.3 Causal Model
- tasks 8 and 9 in data file

### RONI:
- noise for MDS through PCA
- edit data structure image
- add PCA final table resolutions to article
- Graph repressentation
- DeepWalk

## Secondary
### SALEH:


### YAGEL:
- update new pictures in the article after the LAST touch
- FP-growth algorithm
- check pre and post feature outlier handling

### RONI:
- change pictures to their new picture in the article
