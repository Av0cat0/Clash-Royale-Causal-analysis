    "**Analyzing User Behavior in Clash Royale for Strategic Decision Making**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Rationale\n",
    "This project aims to leverage advanced data management algorithms to analyze user behavior in the popular mobile game Clash Royale.<br>\n",
    "By utilizing datasets obtained from Kaggle, we will explore how different user behaviors impact game outcomes.<br>\n",
    "The goal is to apply techniques learned in the course to understand which behaviors lead to winning, prolonged gameplay, and frequent app usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "we will focuses on handling various steps in the data-driven decision-making process, including data integration, cleaning, and exploration.<br>\n",
    "In this project we will address common data issues such as missing data, dirty or inconsistent data, and bias, ensuring trustworthy decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Description\n",
    "We will use the following datasets:\n",
    "1. **BattlesStaging_01012021_WL_tagged.csv**: Contains data on games played on January 1, 2021. each row present 1 game between 2 players.\n",
