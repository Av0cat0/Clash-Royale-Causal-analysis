## DATELINE: 25/02 15:00
### SALEH:
- 2.1 Data Acquisition and 2.1.1 Data Structure in the article, add a graph for 2.1.1
- 2.4.2 Deck Similarity - t-SNE and MDS
-- instead of appearances, check other features and create a subset of features to analyse with MDS/t-SNE, such that will help us conclude conclusions about the high win-rate clusters.
     use yagel's DAGs and the subset to check intreseting OR related features, and create a subplot of all inspected features (we will downsize it later)
- explain why you used hamming/cosine/jaccerd metrices in the article 
- combine plots of MDS/t-sne algorithms to 2 sublplots, each for 1 algorithm which shows all the metrices
- Find a way to create boundaries for decks with high win-rate, so the sub data within the boundaries will show the highest win rates (3 boundaries are good)

### YAGEL:
- 2.2 Exploratory Data Analysis in the article (DAG + small subsection)
- investigate DAG aftermeth
- fix correlation thresholds consistency, there are 3 thresholds: 0.3,0.55,0.7, we need at most 2 so we need to discuss that
-- YOUR GOAL IS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF THRESHOLDS FROM 3 TO 2, WITHIN THE MAIN NOTEBOOK WITH AS LOW AS POSSIBLE MODIFICATIONS
- 2.4.3 Causal Model



## DATELINE: 27/02 15:00
### SALEH:
- Check how to insert MVD usage in code/article
### YAGEL:
- Implement DAG aftermeth 
- FP-growth algorithm
- check the following path: handle_behavior - less outliers, more of target behavior,
     yagel's idea of avg elixer<2 or >6, validate win_rate for those decks
### RONI:
- Graph repressentation
- DeepWalk
- change pictures to their new picture in the article
